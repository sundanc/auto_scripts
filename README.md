# Auto-Scripts Collection

A collection of useful automation scripts for system administration, development, and DevOps tasks.

## IT Arsenal Command Center

The IT Arsenal is a unified command center that brings all scripts together into a cohesive toolkit. This central interface makes it easy to access all scripts in one place, with consistent logging, configuration, and execution handling. [Check my blog post](https://brokeninfra.tech/using_it_arsenal/)

This blog post covers:
- Installation and setup
- Detailed usage instructions for all tool categories
- Advanced features and integrations
- Creating your own arsenal-compatible scripts
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices for IT automation

Whether you're new to the toolkit or looking to master advanced features, this comprehensive guide will help you leverage the full power of the IT Arsenal.

To launch the arsenal:

```bash
chmod +x arsenal.sh
./arsenal.sh
```

The arsenal provides:
- Menu-driven access to all tools
- Unified logging system
- Centralized configuration
- Error handling and notifications
- Easy script execution

## What's New: Enhanced Reliability Features

### System Compatibility Checker

IT Arsenal now includes a robust compatibility checker that verifies if your system meets the requirements to run each script. This helps prevent issues before they occur by checking:

- Required dependencies and tools
- Operating system compatibility  
- User privilege requirements
- Version requirements for critical tools

**How to use:**
1. **Automated checks** - Every script is checked before execution
2. **System-wide scan** - From the main menu, select option `9` to check compatibility of all scripts
3. **Direct usage** - Run `./lib/compatibility_checker.sh script_name.sh` to check a specific script

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents script failures due to missing dependencies
- Provides customized installation commands for your specific OS
- Alerts you to permission requirements before execution
- Saves time by identifying issues proactively

### Advanced Script Debugging

The new script debugging tool (`system/script_debug.sh`) offers comprehensive script analysis:

```bash
# Debug a specific script
./system/script_debug.sh -s system/vm.sh

# Check all scripts in a category
./system/script_debug.sh -c system

# Full system analysis
./system/script_debug.sh -a
```

**Debugging Capabilities:**
- Syntax validation without execution
- Dependency verification
- Static code analysis
- Best practices checks
- Execution recommendations
- Code quality suggestions

### Seamless Integration with IT Arsenal

When a script fails, the arsenal now offers to run a detailed compatibility check to help diagnose and resolve issues. This provides:

- Immediate feedback on what went wrong
- Clear steps to resolve dependencies
- Installation guidance specific to your OS
- User-friendly explanations of complex requirements

## Library Functions

The `lib/common.sh` provides shared functionality for all scripts, including:

- Configuration management
- Logging functions
- System monitoring utilities
- File management helpers
- User interaction tools
- Network utilities

The new `lib/compatibility_checker.sh` provides:
- Dependency verification
- OS compatibility checks
- User privilege validation
- Installation recommendations

To use these functions in your own scripts:

```bash
source "$(dirname "$0")/../lib/common.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/../lib/compatibility_checker.sh"
```

## Usage

Most scripts can be executed directly after making them executable:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
```

However, it's recommended to use the IT Arsenal command center to execute scripts for consistent logging, error handling, and compatibility verification.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this collection by adding new scripts or improving existing ones. Please follow these guidelines:
- Add clear comments to your script
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Use consistent formatting
- Document any dependencies or prerequisites
- Add compatibility information for the compatibility checker
