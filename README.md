# Auto-Scripts Collection

A collection of useful automation scripts for system administration, development, and DevOps tasks.

## IT Arsenal Command Center

The IT Arsenal is a unified command center that brings all scripts together into a cohesive toolkit. This central interface makes it easy to access all scripts in one place, with consistent logging, configuration, and execution handling. [Check my blog post](https://brokeninfra.tech/using_it_arsenal/)

This blog post covers:
- Installation and setup
- Detailed usage instructions for all tool categories
- Advanced features and integrations
- Creating your own arsenal-compatible scripts
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices for IT automation

Whether you're new to the toolkit or looking to master advanced features, this comprehensive guide will help you leverage the full power of the IT Arsenal.


To launch the arsenal:

```bash
chmod +x arsenal.sh
./arsenal.sh
```

The arsenal provides:
- Menu-driven access to all tools
- Unified logging system
- Centralized configuration
- Error handling and notifications
- Easy script execution

## Library Functions

The `lib/common.sh` provides shared functionality for all scripts, including:

- Configuration management
- Logging functions
- System monitoring utilities
- File management helpers
- User interaction tools
- Network utilities

To use these functions in your own scripts:

```bash
source "$(dirname "$0")/../lib/common.sh"
```

## Usage

Most scripts can be executed directly after making them executable:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
```

However, it's recommended to use the IT Arsenal command center to execute scripts for consistent logging and error handling.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this collection by adding new scripts or improving existing ones. Please follow these guidelines:
- Add clear comments to your script
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Use consistent formatting
- Document any dependencies or prerequisites

## License

These scripts are provided as-is under the MIT license. Use at your own risk.
